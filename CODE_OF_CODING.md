# Code of Coding

1. Contributions related to the project's code and continued development are
the paramount duty and evaluative basis of the project's participants. All other activities 
within the project scope are trivial by comparision, and those not within project scope
are irrelevant. 

2. The merit of contributions will be judged on the basis of their value to the project,
either by their introduction and implementation of new featuresets and solutions, 
or their superiority over existing ones. 

3. Individual characteristics, both immutable and chosen, are immaterial to the project's scope 
and considerations of participants' value or their contributions to the project; attempts
to bring them to its forefront are anathema to both the project's
primary goals and the duties of its contributors. 

4. The project creators/lead developers/core team are the overseers of the 
project and have ultimate decision-making power over the project in all 
respects they choose, be they technical, structural, organizational, 
personal, or otherwise. 

5. Actions that can, under a reasonable standard, be likely to damage 
a contributor's well-being, employment, or personal relations have no place within 
the project or its communication channels. 

6. By contributing to the project, participants agree to follow this Code in both letter
and in spirit of the pursual of meritocracy embodied herein. 

**tl;dr: Write good code that doesn't suck, leave politics and personal issues at the door. **
